# Avocado-Timer-Source-Files
This is the source code for a small Unity project which I use as a timer for running. To open it, download the Unity Hub, install Unity, download this repository, and open it in the Unity game engine. 

Note: In order to view it once you enter Unity, you will have to open the Scenes folder and open the Sample Scene file.
